## The Intelligence Leak
Using public LLMs for enterprise logic is a form of "Data Hemorrhage." Every prompt trains your competitor’s model. 

## The SLM Advantage
Sovereign SLMs (Small Language Models) like Mistral-derived or Llama-4-quantized variants allow for:
* **Zero-Latency Logic:** Processing at the edge, not the cloud.
* **Data Sovereignty:** Your proprietary "Business DNA" never leaves your local firewall.
* **Weight Customization:** Training the model specifically on your industry’s semantic nuances.

## Result
Sovereignty isn't just about privacy; it's about **Vertical Intelligence Control**.
