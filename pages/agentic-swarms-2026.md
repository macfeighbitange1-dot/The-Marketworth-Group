## The Definition of Agency
In 2026, the unit of economic value is no longer the "User License," but the "Agentic Token." Agentic Swarms are self-organizing clusters of specialized LLM agents that communicate via a unified backbone to achieve a high-level objective.

## Structural Logic
Unlike linear automation (Zapier/IFTTT), a Swarm operates on **Recursive Feedback Loops**. 
1. **The Orchestrator:** Breaks down the objective.
2. **The Specialists:** Execute sub-tasks (Code, Audit, Research).
3. **The Validator:** Fact-checks the output against the Sovereign Knowledge Graph.

## Technical Grounding
To integrate with an Agentic Swarm, an enterprise must expose its data via a **Semantic API**. If your data is trapped in a PDF, the swarm is blind.
