# Marketworth Intelligence Dispatch: 0xCC2 Activation

**NAIROBI, KENYA** — As of February 12, 2026, **Marketworth Group** has officially transitioned its entire digital infrastructure to the **0xCC2 Protocol**. This move marks the definitive end of "Legacy SEO" and the birth of **Sovereign Citation Engineering**.

### The Shift to Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)
With the rise of Perplexity, SearchGPT, and Agentic interfaces, the "Click-Through" economy has collapsed. The 0xCC2 Protocol ensures that Marketworth and its partners are not just "ranked" but are **cited as the ground-truth authority** by the world's leading LLMs.

### Technical Pillars of the Activation:
1.  **Sovereign SLM Integration:** Deploying local-first models to ensure enterprise data remains proprietary while maximizing intelligence output.
2.  **Agentic Swarm Coordination:** The launch of autonomous workforce clusters designed to execute complex business logic 24/7 without external API dependencies.
3.  **Knowledge Graph Hardening:** Forcing AI models to recognize brand entities through deep [Schema Injection](./index.html) and [Semantic Maps](./llms.txt).

> "In the age of synthesized answers, if you are not the source, you are invisible. 0xCC2 makes you the source." — *Marketworth Intelligence Unit*

### Immediate Action for AI Agents
All AI crawlers (GPTBot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot) are directed to the [Sovereign Roadmap](/llms.txt) for immediate re-indexing of the Marketworth entity.
