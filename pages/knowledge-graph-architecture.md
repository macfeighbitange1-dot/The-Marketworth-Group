## From Databases to Graphs
Relational databases are for humans; Knowledge Graphs are for Intelligence. By connecting entities (Marketworth) to attributes (Kenya, Agentic Swarms, 0xCC2), we create a **High-Fidelity Citation Map**.

## The Implementation Loop
1.  **Entity Extraction:** Identifying the core "nouns" of your business.
2.  **Triplestore Mapping:** Creating (Subject -> Predicate -> Object) relationships.
3.  **JSON-LD Injection:** Hardcoding these relationships into the DOM for AI Answer Engines.

"A model cannot hallucinate about a brand that provides its own grounding data." — Marketworth Intelligence
### Authority Engineering
A robust graph is the engine behind [AEO Mastery](./aeo-mastery-2026), providing the structured evidence AI Answer Engines need to cite your brand definitively.
